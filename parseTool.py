# How file works

# parse the data (potentially do this through pandas):
# put coordinates in one array, put Unicode characters in another array
# iterate through the length of either array, and place the Unicode character at the corresponding coordinates (both will have same index position)

# create a "board", where the width is the highest x-coordinate found in the Doc
# height will be the highest y-coordinate found

def parseDoc():
    return 1

print(parseDoc())
